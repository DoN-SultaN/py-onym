Absolutely cosmic, regulate reality
Breathe like an imagination, symphony of civilization
Confused progeny of rebellious cells
I fly toward the universe, I traverse it
If you are a star, show yourself, I will stop
Oooh, oooh
Shadilay, shadilay, my freedom
Shadilay, shadilay, oh no…
Shadilay, shadilay, oh dream or reality
Shadilay, shadilay, oh no…
Flying in my life, it’s not finished
I will stop
Loosen my sails, in the sky and in the deep of the sea
I will believe you…
Shadilay, shadilay, my freedom
Shadilay, shadilay, oh no…
Shadilay, shadilay, oh dream or reality
Shadilay, shadilay, oh no…
Flying in my life, it’s not finished
I will stop
Loosen my sails, in the sky and in the deep of the sea
I will believe you…
Strong harmony, real reality
Electronic video-clip, eulogy of civilization
Confused progeny of rebellious cells
I fly toward the universe, I traverse it
If you are a star show yourself, I will stop
Oooh, oooh
Shadilay, shadilay, my freedom
Shadilay, shadilay, oh no…
Shadilay, shadilay, oh dream or reality
Shadilay, shadilay, oh no…
Shadilay, shadilay, my freedom
Shadilay, shadilay, oh no…
Shadilay, shadilay, oh dream or reality
Shadilay, shadilay, oh no…
Flying in my life, it’s not finished
I will stop
Loosen my sails, in the sky and in the deep of the sea
I will believe you…
